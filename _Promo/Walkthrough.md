# How to play the "low sanity" minigame game.  
- The green bar at the top of the screen is your health. You prevent yourself from suicide by clicking the green words.  
- If you are color blind, you can activate the color blind mode from the options. Green words get a plus icon, red words get a minus icon.  
- The blood pressure nurse gives you the "low sanity" minigame. If you succeed, you gain a sanity point, and if you fail, you lose one sanity. You don't die in that specific minigame.  
- During the ritual minigame, you have to click the red words instead as you are trying to sacrifice yourself.  

# If you are low on sanity:  
- Go to the prayer room every 8 hours (every time pass.)  
- Talk to the blood pressure measuring nurse (pink eyes) every 8 hours. She's in the right hallway during morning and evening (but not at night). She gives you the "low sanity" minigame. If you succeed, you gain a sanity point, and if you fail, you lose one sanity.  
- At night, talk to the nurse in the left hallway (blue eyes). She gives you chocolate milk, you don't have to drink it, you gain one sanity point.  
- Using the phone booth in the right hallway, call your parents. You gain one sanity when you call them during morning and evening. And you gain another sanity when you call them at night. (total of 2 sanity gains).  

# How to perform the ritual  
The ritual steps are:  
1- "Call a number." You learn this step by going to group for the first time.  
To achieve this step: There's a phone booth in the right hallway from where you spawn. You have to call the number on the second day (same day as the ritual). Calling it on the first day does nothing.  

2- "Eat a specific meal: Meat and Apple juice." You learn this step by going to therapy for the first time.  
To achieve this step: There is no specific "meat" food item. You must eat the "burger" from the dinner menu.  
You can eat the meat and apple juice in any order, but if you eat a third item, this step will fail.  
If you ate something other than meat and apple juice, you can pass the time by 8 hours and then eat the correct meal.  
You eat meals by clicking TAB and then clicking on the food item in the inventory, then clicking "Eat".  
When you eat the burger, you automatically get "burger bread." Do not eat the "burger bread."

3- "The sacrifice." You learn this step by talking to the chaplain twice (prayer room).  
To achieve this step: you don't have to do anything before the ritual! During the ritual, you are given the option to sacrifice yourself or the chaplain. Both achieve the same result.  
Alternatively, you can kill the cat in group session 2 or 3, but you must have a sharp pencil (not dull).  
To get a sharp pencil, you are given a sharp pencil when you go to dinner and sign the questionnaire. You must sign less than 5 bullet points to keep the pencil sharp. (I suggest signing only apple juice and burger, as the other food items don't do anything).  
During the ritual minigame, you have to click the red words instead as you are trying to sacrifice yourself. If you fail that minigame, you get the ending where the chaplain sacrifices himself instead.  

# How to beat the epilogue  
- When you encounter the dark hallway, hold the "close eyes" button (F or Right Mouse) to see the path forward.  
- Finally, go past the prison cells, then go up the stairs and talk to the Military Man (red eyes) to finish the game.
