[Short Description]
Story-driven visual novel. The fate of the world relies on one schizophrenic person.

[Long Description]
Story-driven visual novel. The fate of the world relies on one schizophrenic person.

Controls:
- WASD / Arrow keys: Left and Right rotate you like a tank. Up and Down move you forwards or backward.
- 1-9 keys or mouse to select choices in dialogue. 
- You cannot look up or down! This is intentional due to web game limits. Mouse lock on the web is bug-prone and unintuitive from my experience in making web FPS games.
