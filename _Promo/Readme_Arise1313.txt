Controls:  
- WASD / Arrow keys: Left and Right rotate you like a tank. Up and Down move you forwards or backward.  
- Press P or TAB to see inventory and options menu.  
- Hold right mouse click or F to close eyes. Helpful to identify the name of the rooms and for some puzzles.  
- Press left mouse click or E to use/talk.  
- Use mouse or number keys 1 and 2 to select choices in dialogue.  

Notes:  
- performance is better on Chrome than Firefox.  
- You cannot look up or down! This is intentional due to web game limits. Mouse lock on the web is bug-prone and unintuitive from my experience in making web FPS games.
