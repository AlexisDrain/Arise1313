# Arise1313
Asylum simulator, visual novel. The fate of the world relies on one schizophrenic person.  

Walkthrough  
https://github.com/AlexisDrain/Arise1313/blob/main/_Promo/Walkthrough.md  

Controls:  
- WASD / Arrow keys: Left and Right rotate you like a tank. Up and Down move you forwards or backward.  
- Press P or TAB to see inventory and options menu.  
- Hold right mouse click or F to close eyes. Helpful to identify the name of the rooms and for one puzzle.  
- Press left mouse click or E to use/talk.  
- Use mouse or number keys 1 and 2 to select choices in dialogue.  

Notes:  
- Performance is better on Chrome than Firefox.  
- Performance is better with fullscreen disabled.
- You cannot look up or down! This is intentional due to web game limits. Mouse lock on the web is bug-prone and unintuitive from my experience in making web FPS games.  

# Cheats
On your keyboard, hold both buttons at the same time while you are in the 3d game (i.e. walking in the asylum):  
"C + 1" -> Enable cheats (press this first to enable the rest).  

"G + 1" -> Go to morning (of the current day.)  
"G + 2" -> Go to evening (of the current day.)  
"G + 3" -> Go to midnight (of the current day.)  
"G + 7" -> Go to day 2.  
"J + 1" -> learn all steps of the ritual.  
"J + 2" -> decrease sanity.  
"J + 3" -> increase sanity.  
"J + 5" -> skip to epilogue.  
"H + 1" -> increase how many times you've been to therapist.  
"H + 2" -> increase how many times you've been to group.  
"H + 3" -> increase how many times you've been to chaplain/prayer.  
"K + 3" -> Give all food items in the game.  
"K + 4" -> Become hungry (kind of buggy).  
"G + 4" -> skip intro novel. Very buggy.
